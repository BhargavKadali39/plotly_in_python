# plotly_in_python
 This repo shows ypu how to design a tree map using plotly module in  python.
 
Treemaps are used to visualize hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles.
It displays hierarchical data in such a way that each branch of the tree receives a rectangle which is filled with smaller rectangles as sub-branches.

Example

Here the white outer block is a which can also be known as root of all rectangles(sub branches).
